                        Password management is very important to implement with various accounts most people 
                        may have on the internet. It can help keep your private information safe from those 
                        with malicious intent. Surprisingly the most common passwords are the most simplistic 
                        type of passwords you could think of. For example, “123456’, ‘qwerty’, ‘77777777’, 
                        ‘1111111’, etc. Passwords like these should never be used as they could be hacked very 
                        quickly.
                         To help avoid this there are a few key things we need to do:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="blog-text">
                        <li>Make sure your password isn’t the same as your user name</li>	
                        <li>Use little to no repeating characters</li>
                        <li>Use little to no consecutive characters (such as ‘1234’ or ‘abcd’)</li>
                        <li>Keep password length over 10 characters long</li>
                        <li>Do further research on good password practices</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Another common issue is recycling passwords. More and more users open online accounts, 
                        creating too many passwords for them to remember, which eventually leads to the dangerous 
                        habit of recycling passwords. Thousands of compromised login credentials can be tested in 
                        just seconds against many different shopping sites, social medial accounts, and online banks
                        by hacking their software. Be sure to never reuse your passwords for important accounts. 
                        A good way to keep all your passwords organized while not losing track of which one goes 
                        where is to use a program called a “password manager”. In addition to serving as a sort of 
                        extra memory, a password manager will save you time by allowing you to enter your passwords 
                        across several devices. A few companies that offer this service are Dashlane, 1Password and 
                        Lastpass. Be sure to research each company further to see which is right for you or if there 
                        are and additional companies out there that offer similar services. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        On top of good password practices and password managers there is an extra security measure 
                        you can take which is using Two-Factor Authentication otherwise known as 2FA. With 2FA, a 
                        user enters both their username and a password to ensure that the person attempting to 
                        access an online account is who they claim to be. However, it is not as simple as gaining 
                        access right away, they must provide another factor as well which may include:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="blog-text">
                        <li>A key stroke pattern</li>
                        <li>A PIN </li>
                        <li>Answering secret questions</li>
                        <li>A Password</li>
                        <li>Credit card number</li>
                        <li>Finger print</li>
                        <li>Iris scan</li>
                        <li>Voice print</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        With this security measure it is not likely that anyone trying to steal your account 
                        information will have the second security measure to do so keeping user accounts safe.
