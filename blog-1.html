                      Secure Sockets Layer, commonly known as SSL, is a cryptographic protocol that ensures website
                      data is secure and private. In 1999 SSL was replaced by Transport Layer Security, otherwise 
                      known as TLS which has the same function a SSL but it’s more of an upgraded version. 
                      Encryption involves converting the original representation of the information, called 
                      plaintext, into an alternate representation known as ciphertext. Only authorized parties can 
                      deceive any encryption back to plaintext. The protection of sensitive information from 
                      cyber-theft and hackers is a critical element of web security. Without proactive security 
                      measures, businesses risk malware infections, attacks on other websites, networks, and IT 
                      infrastructures. Successful attacks can spread from computer to computer, making it difficult 
                      to determine the source. This is also bad news for the use of the website as their information 
                      can be stolen.

                    <p class="blog-text">In order to check if a website is secure, you’ll need to do the following: </p>
                      <ul class="blog-text">
                          <li>
                            Look at the website address. If your website has only “HTTP” it may not be secure. The
                            address needs to have “HTTPS” at the beginning to ensure you have an SSL/TLS certificate
                            for security.
                          </li>
                          <li>	Do your research on website malware such as phishing kits, malvertising, defacements etc. </li>
                          <li>
                                Check if the trust seal is legitimate by clicking on it. It should take you to a different page. Look
                            into the company that is providing the security to ensure the seal authentic.
                          </li>
                          <li>	Be sure to look for a privacy policy and read it. It should clearly state how they are using your information. </li>
                          <li>	Look for any contact information which can include social media accounts, a phone number, and an address. </li>
