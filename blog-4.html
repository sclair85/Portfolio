                    <p class="blog-text">
                      There are a wide variety of weapons to be found in Counter Strike: Global Offensive. A number 
                      of them are tempting for beginners to start with since they look pretty impressive. As an 
                      example, beginners may be disappointed if they start with the Desert Eagle or AWP at they will 
                      find it hard to get a good head shot out of them. The best course of action here is to choose 
                      a weapon is more effective as represented in the table below:
                    </p>

                              <th>Type</th>
                              <th>Team</th>
                          </tr>
                      </thead>
                      <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Tec-9</td>

                      Use these weapons until you are at a sufficient skill level to move on to others. This will 
                      bring more wins in your game sessions and make you a better player overall.

                    <h2>Improving Accuracy</h2>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                      It's best learn how to use your weapons more effectively and there are a few aspects to learn 
                      about such as weapon damage, spray pattern and rate of fire. When approching an enemy be sure 
                      not to just empty your magazine on them, it's far better use burst fire (3 to 6 shots at a 
                      time) or a single accurate headshot, otherwise known as tapping. Below are lists of 
                      information that shows the benefits of tapping and burst fire.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tapping</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                      This technique is typically used in long range situations. The shots are to be made standing 
                      still, one shot at a time, and strafing to cover immediatly afterwards so you have a break for 
                      the recoil. Advantages of this technique are:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="blog-text">
                      <li>Minimal Recoil for more accuracy</li>
                      <li>Moving around is easier</li>
                      <li>Keeps reloading to a minimum</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Burst Fire</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                      Burst fire is best used in close range and possibly medium range. Here you will need to fire 
                      3-6 shots at a time and as with tapping you need to stand still while shooting and take cover 
                      after. You will find the following advantages with this technique:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="blog-text">
                      <li>Shots are more accurate</li>
                      <li>Can be more effective in taking out opponents</li>
                      <li>Expend less ammunition </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                      These are just a few techniques to get you started. There's much more to explore in CS:GO and 
                      it would be advised to do further research on the many topics of this game.
