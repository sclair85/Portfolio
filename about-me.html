                        My name is Sam. I'm a student at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in the 
                        software developement program. I enrolled in the program for a few reasons. I wanted 
                        to have an exciting career that is constantly challenging me, have an environment where 
                        I’m constantly learning new things, and most importantly I wanted to do something I enjoy 
                        for a living. With technology I like being able to connect with people, sharing thoughts 
                        and ideas, sharing photos, being able to watch a YouTube video from anywhere, playing games, 
                        and making new creations such as art, music, or making a program of some sort.

                        I grew up in a small city near Cincinnati, Ohio. I lived there pretty much all of my life. 
                        When I grew a bit older I decided to move to Winnipeg, Manitoba and I’ve been here since 2011.

                        I am passionate about learning new skills and helping others when I can. Among the skills I 
                        like to learn are a few hobbies I have. I enjoy playing instruments, I’m only working on 
                        playing piano at the moment but I can play other instruments like guitar, bass, harmonica, 
                        and ukulele. Although I’m most likely a little out of practice with them now. I also enjoy
                         making art, mostly just drawing but some digital painting as well. A couple of  examples 
                         of my art are below. I sometimes like to play video games but mostly I've been playing VR 
                         games recently. Once in a while I enjoy making sourdough bread with a homemade starter or 
                         I’ll just use yeast if I feel the need. I’ll make things like hamburger buns, loaves/boules 
                         of bread, cinnamon buns, garlic sticks, or pizza. Lastly I like to collect and solve puzzle 
                         cubes like rubik’s cubes, megaminx, pyraminx, etc. If you notice in the digital painting 
                         below of my desk there are 3x3 and 2x2 rubik's cubes.
